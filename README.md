fife-rpg
========
The goal of fife-rpg is to rewrite PARPG so it can be used to easily create other RPGs with it even if PARPG will die. As PARPG it will use the FIFEngine (http://fifengine.net/) and bGrease (https://github.com/Beliaar/bGrease).
It will use the source of PARPG (http://www.parpg.net) as a basis and build upon it.

The documentation, including installation instructions, can be found here: http://fife-rpg.github.com
